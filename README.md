## PostDoc Researcher & Freelance Algorithm Engineer
[TU Braunschweig, Algorithms Group (Prof. Fekete)](https://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/alg/)

I research, teach, and consult in algorithm engineering, specializing in NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems by leveraging Mixed Integer Programming, Constraint Programming, SAT solvers, graph algorithms, and meta-heuristics.
My key strength is in my full-stack expertise, blending theoretical computer science, operations research, mathematical optimization, data science, and robust software engineering.
In my roles at the university and as a freelance consultant, I have successfully applied my skills across diverse projects, and I am always open to further opportunities that let me deepen and broaden my skill set.

**How my combined skills add value:**

* **Theoretical Computer Science & Algorithm Engineering:** My background enables me to abstract problems, identify their complexities, and recognize practical implications beyond worst-case analyses. I know when to trust O-notation, and when not.
* **Mathematical Optimization & Software Engineering:** I efficiently translate problems into mathematical formulations and troubleshoot solver performance. I also employ Test-Driven Development and strong software engineering practices to ensure robust, maintainable code, minimizing hidden bugs and maximizing agility.
* **Operations Research & Practical Deployment:** My consulting experience enables me to adapt theoretical algorithms effectively to real-world scenarios, smoothly transitioning between theoretical abstractions and practical deployments (e.g., Linux servers, CI/CD, Docker).
* **Generalist Insight:** Familiarity with various optimization techniques allows me to choose the most suitable tools, avoid biases toward particular methods, and creatively misuse techniques to solve unconventional challenges effectively.
* **Cross-Disciplinary Agility:** Working concurrently in research, teaching, and consulting, I rapidly adapt to diverse problems, bridging gaps between academic theory, textbook scenarios, and practical solutions.

**Key Contributions:**

* **CP-SAT Primer:** If you are involved with optimization, you might have already stumbled over my [CP-SAT Primer](https://d-krupke.github.io/cpsat-primer/).
* **CG:SHOP Competitions:** If you are active in the computational geometry community, you might recognize me as the technical organizer for [the competitions at CG Week](https://cgshop.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/).
* **Open Problems Project (#53):** Provided [an intricate NP-hardness proof](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00224-024-10178-8.pdf) resolving an open theoretical problem.
* **Pairwise Interaction Sampling:** Developed a [state-of-the-art algorithm achieving provable optimality on numerous benchmark instances for the first time](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3712193).
* **Coverage Path Planning:** I (co-)authored [multiple papers](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=rZ4784MAAAAJ&hl=en) on coverage path planning, with some further ones in the pipeline.
