### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

PostDoc Researcher at the Algorithms Groups (Prof. Fekete), TU Braunschweig, Germany.

Many provably difficult (NP-hard) problems can still be solved well in practice, contrary to what theoretical computer science purports.
I have experience in doing just this, using various techniques such as Mixed Integer Linear Programming, Constraint Programming, SAT-Solvers, Large Neighborhood Search, Dynamic Programming, Meta-Heuristics, Reinforcement Learning, etc., and I am always looking to extend my toolkit.
My educational background in theoretical computer science allows me to understand the core of the problems as well as the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms, while my joy in programming and experimental evaluation allows me to implement the appropriate algorithms that have excellent performance in practice.

You can learn more about these techniques in my [dissertation (Algorithm Engineering for Hard Problems in Computational Geometry](https://krupke.cc/assets/pdf/dissertation_veroeffentlichung.pdf) or in the [CP-SAT Primer](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer) that I originally wrote for my  students but also other people seem to find it useful.

I also develop tools to make developing and evaluating algorithms easier.
* [slurminade](https://github.com/d-krupke/slurminade) to distribute experiments over multiple workstations with slurm.
* [AlgBench](https://github.com/d-krupke/AlgBench) to save the results (and all metadata) without the need for lots of boilerplate code or a separate database.
* [skbuild_conan](https://github.com/d-krupke/skbuild-conan) is an extension of [scikit-build](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build) to easily add C++-dependencies via conan.

Other projects:
* [CheckMyTex](https://github.com/d-krupke/CheckMyTex) to proofread LaTeX-documents with a portfolio of available utils. Developed for polishing my dissertation.
