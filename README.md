PostDoc Researcher at the [Algorithms Groups (Prof. Fekete), TU Braunschweig, Germany](https://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/alg/).

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am an experienced algorithm engineer with a strong background in theoretical computer science.
With a passion for solving complex (especially NP-hard) problems, I bring together the power of theory and practical implementation to deliver innovative solutions.

Over the past 10 years, I have honed my skills in algorithm engineering, successfully applying a diverse range of techniques such as Mixed Integer Linear Programming, Convex Optimization, Constraint Programming, SAT-Solvers, Large Neighborhood Search, specialized Branch&Bound implementations, Dynamic Programming, Meta-Heuristics, Reinforcement Learning, and more.
These tools have enabled me to tackle challenging problems in various domains, including Robot Path Planning, Bioinformatics, Satellite Management, Assembly, and Swarm Robotics.
See my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=rZ4784MAAAAJ&hl=en) profile for a list of publications.

My academic journey is marked by outstanding achievements, including a [Dissertation](https://krupke.cc/assets/pdf/dissertation_veroeffentlichung.pdf), Master's, and Bachelor's degrees, all awarded with top grades (Summa Cum Laude/"With Honors"/"With Honors").
I have been recognized with multiple best paper awards (CIAC 2019, ALENEX23) and esteemed student accolades for exceptional accomplishments.

As a co-organizer and technical lead for the [CG:SHOP Challenges](https://cgshop.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/), I have actively contributed to the advancement of algorithm engineering.
These challenges focus on hard problems in computational geometry and have provided a platform for collaboration, innovation, and knowledge sharing within the community.

In addition to my theoretical and coding expertise, I have led transformative initiatives at the TU Braunschweig, Algorithms Group, driving the transition from outdated techniques for algorithm engineering to a structured approach with modern methodologies.
Drawing inspiration from various communities, including Experimental Algorithms, Machine Learning, Bioinformatics, and High-Performance Computing, I strive to increase the reproducibility, reusability, and automation in Algorithm Engineering.

<!--On this GitHub profile, you will find a collection of my projects that demonstrate my problem-solving abilities and practical implementations.
